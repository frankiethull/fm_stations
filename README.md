# FM STATIONS MINED FROM WIKIPEDIA

The data this week comes from [SOURCE_OF_DATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_radio_stations_in_the_United_States). 

The dataset included was mined from all 50 states, tidying column names, binding and aggregating. 

The difficulty is many genres that overlap, which would make a good tidytuesday challenge using library(strings). 

Data is interesting, as genre popularity differs by state/city, also interesting to plot spatially.
